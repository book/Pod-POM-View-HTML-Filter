Revision history for Pod-POM-View-HTML-Filter

0.05 Thu Oct 14 11:44:14 CEST 2004
        [FEATURES]
        - support stacking filters by using the | notation
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - =for blocks now accept filter options
        - much better processing for the content of the begin section
        - support for shell colouring with Maddingue's Syntax::Highlight::Shell
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - much more documentation with many examples
        [FIXES]
        - removed the pasted code from Pod::POM::View::HTML (see 0.03)

0.04 Tue Tue Oct 12 09:46:17 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - when the filter is not known by PPVHF, simply use the default
          filter (<pre>...</pre>)
        - $Pod::POM::View::HTML::Filter::default is the default filter
        [FIXES]
        - set Getopt::Long::Configure back to defaults just before calling
          perltidy, which may break otherwise
        - consistently use carp and croak

0.03 Thu Jul 29 01:05:02 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - more flexible interface for the add() method, that lets one
          add more parameters to a filter (requires, verbatim)
        - the verbatim mode for filters prevent the present()
          method to be called on the verbatim, text and code items it
          contains. The content of all items is catenated and passed to
          the filter as a single block.
        - support for html filtering, thanks to Maddingue's
          Syntax::Highlight::HTML.
        [BUGS]
        - for some unknown reason, presenting the pod twice is broken
          with the perl filter (TODO test added).
        - view_seq_text is copied verbatim from Pod::POM::View::HTML,
          because I need to access a private variable. This should be
          fixed, because duplicated code is never good.
        [FIXES]
        - Makefile.PL lists the prerequisites forgotten in 0.02

0.02 Mon Jul 26 15:00:28 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - limited support for =begin filter options
        - perl_filter can now accept options (such as -nnn)

0.01 Mon Jul 26 12:11:00 CEST 2004
        [FEATURES]
        - add(), know(), filters()
        - =begin filter foo
        - =for filter=foo
        Did I mention it's the first version?
