Revision history for Pod-POM-View-HTML-Filter

0.03 Thu Jul 29 01:01:30 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - more flexible interface for the  add() method, that lets one
          add more parameters to a filter (requires, verbatim)
        - the verbatim mode for filters prevent the present()
          method to be called on the verbatim, text and code items it
          contains. The content of all items is catenated and passed to
          the filter as a single block.
        - support for html filtering, thanks to Maddingue's
          Syntax::Highlight::HTML.
        [BUGS]
        - for some unknown reason, presenting the pod twice is broken
          with the perl filter (TODO test added). I suspect the problem
        - view_seq_text is copied verbatim from Pod::POM::View::HTML,
          because I need to access a private variable. This should be
          fixed, because duplicated code is never good.
        [FIXES]
        - Makefile.PL lists the prerequisites forgotten in 0.02

0.02 Mon Jul 26 15:00:28 CEST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - limited support for =begin filter options
        - perl_filter can now accept options (such as -nnn)

0.01 Mon Jul 26 12:11:00 CEST 2004
        [FEATURES]
        - add(), know(), filters()
        - =begin filter foo

        Did I mention it's the first version?
